{"text": "Section 2 of A Curious Dream and Other Sketches by Mark Twain. This LibriVox recording is in the public domain. A New Beecher Church. If the Reverend Mr. Smith, or the Reverend Mr. Jones, or the Reverend Mr. Brown were about to build a new church edifice, it would be projected on the same old pattern and be like pretty much all the other churches in the country. And so I would naturally mention it as a new Presbyterian church or a new Methodist or a new Baptist church, and never think of calling it by the pastor's name. But when a Beecher projects a church, that edifice is necessarily going to be something entirely fresh and original. It is not going to be like any other church in the world. It is going to be as variegated, eccentric, and marked with as peculiar and striking an individuality as a Beecher himself. It is going to have a deal more Beecher in it than any one narrow creed can fit into without rattling or any one arbitrary order of architecture can symmetrically enclose and cover. Consequently, to call it simply a congregational church would not give half an idea of the thing. There is only one word broad enough and wide enough and deep enough to take in the whole affair and express it cleanly, luminously, and concisely, and that is Beecher. The projected edifice I am about to speak of is therefore properly named in my caption as a new Beecher church. The projector is the Reverend Thomas K. Beecher, brother of the other one, of course. I never knew but one Beecher that wasn't, and he was a nephew. The new church is to be built in Elmira, New York, where Mr. Bee has been preaching to one in the same congregation for the last sixteen years, and is thoroughly esteemed and beloved by his people. I have had the opportunity to hear all about the new church, for I have lately been visiting in Elmira. Now when one has that disease which gives its possessor the title of humorist, he must make oath to his statements, else the public will not believe him. Therefore I make solemn oath that what I am going to tell about the new church is the strict truth. The main building, for there are to be three massed together in a large grassy square ornamented with quite a forest of shade trees, will be the church proper. It will be lofty in order to secure good air and ventilation. The auditorium will be circular, an amphitheater after the ordinary pattern of an opera house without galleries. It is to seat a thousand persons. On one side, or one end if you choose, will be an ample raised platform for the minister, the rear half of which will be occupied by the organ and the choir. Before the minister will be the circling amphitheater of pews, the first thirty or forty on the level floor and the next rising in graduated tiers to the walls. The seats on the level floor will be occupied by the aged and infirm who can enter the church through a hall under the speaker's platform without climbing any stairs. The people occupying the raised tiers will enter by a dozen doors opening into the church from a lobby like an opera house lobby, and descend the various aisles to their places. In case of fire or earthquakes, these numerous exits will be convenient and useful. No space is to be wasted. Under the raised tiers of pews are to be stalls for horses and carriages, so that these may be sheltered from sun and rain. There will be twenty-four of these stalls, each stall to be entered by an arch of ornamental masonry. No doors to open or shut. Consequently, the outside base of the church will have a formidable porthole look like a man-of-war. The stalls are to be so mailed with deadeners and so thoroughly plastered that neither sound nor smell can ascend to the church and offend the worshipers. The horses will be in attendance at church but an hour or two at a time, of course, and can defile the stalls but little. An immediate cleansing after they leave is to set that all right again. There is to be no steeple on the church, merely because no practical use can be made of it. There is to be no bell because all men know what time church service begins without that exasperating nuisance. In explanation of this remark I will state that at home I suffer in the vicinity and under the distracting clanger of thirteen church bells, all of whom \u2014is that right? \u2014clamor at once, and no two in a court. A large part of my time is taken up in devising cruel and unusual sufferings, and, in fancy, inflicting them on those bell-ringers and having a good time. The second building is to be less lofty than the church, is to be built right against the rear of it, and communicate with it by a door. It is to have two stories. On the first floor will be three distinct Sunday-school rooms, all large, but one considerably larger than the other two. The Sunday-school, connected with Mr. Beecher's church, has always been a graded one, in each department singularly thorough in its grade of instruction. The pupil wins his advancement to the higher grades by hard-won proficiency, not by mere added years. The largest of the three compartments will be used as the main Sunday-school room and for the weekday evening lecture. The whole upper story of this large building will be well lighted and ventilated, and occupied wholly as a playroom for the children of the church, and it will stand open and welcome to them through all the weekdays. They can fill it with their playthings if they choose, and, besides, it will be furnished with dumbbells, swings, rocking horses, and all such matters as children delight in. The idea is to make a child look upon a church as only another home, and a sunny one, rather than as a dismal exile or a prison. The third building will be less lofty than the second. It will adjoin the rear of the second and communicate with it by a door or doors. It will consist of three stories. Like the other two buildings, it will cover considerable ground. On the first floor will be the church parlors, where the usual social gatherings of modern congregations are held. On the same floor and opening into the parlors will be a reception room, and also a circulating library, a free library, not simply free to the church membership, but to everybody, just as is the present library of Mr. Beecher's church, and few libraries are more extensively and more diligently and gratefully used than this one. Also on this first floor and communicating with the parlors will be, tell it not in Gath, publish it not in Ascalon, six bathrooms, hot and cold water, free tickets issued to any applicant among the unclean of the congregation. The idea is sound and sensible for this reason. Many members of all congregations have no good bathing facilities and are not able to pay for them at the barber shops without feeling the expense. And yet, a luxurious bath is a thing that all civilized beings greatly enjoy and derive healthful benefit from. The church buildings are to be heated by steam, and consequently the waste steam can be very judiciously utilized in the proposed bathrooms. In speaking of this bathroom project, I have revealed a state secret, but I never could keep one of any kind, state or otherwise. Even the congregation were not to know of this matter, the building committee were to leave it unmentioned in their report. But I got hold of it, and from a member of that committee too, and I had rather part with one of my hind legs than keep still about it. The bathrooms are unquestionably to be built, and so why not tell it? In the second story of this third building will be the permanent residence of the church missionary, a lady who constantly looks after the poor and sick of the church. Also a set of lodging and living rooms for the janitors, or janitresses, for they will be women, Mr. Beecher, holding that women are tidier and more efficient in such a position than men, and that they ought to dwell upon the premises and give them their undivided care. Also on this second floor are to be six rooms to do duty as a church infirmary for the sick poor of the congregation. This church, having always supported and taken care of its own unfortunates instead of leaving them to the public charity. In the infirmary will be kept one or two waterbeds for invalids whose pains will not allow them to lie on a less yielding substance, and half a dozen reclining invalid chairs on wheels. The waterbeds and invalid chairs at present belonging to the church are always in demand and never out of service. Part of the appurtenances of the new church will be a horse and an easy vehicle to be kept and driven by a janitor and used wholly for giving the church's indigent invalids air and exercise. It is found that such an establishment is daily needed, so much so indeed as to almost amount to a church necessity. The third story of this third building is to be occupied as the church kitchen, and it is sensibly placed aloft so that the ascending noises and boardinghouse smells shall go up and aggravate the birds instead of the saints, except such of the latter as are above the clouds and they can easily keep out of the way of it no doubt. Dumbwaiters will carry the food down to the church parlors instead of up. Why is it that nobody has thought of the simple wisdom of this arrangement before? Is it for a church to step forward and tell us how to get rid of kitchen smells and noises? If it be asked why the new church will need a kitchen, I remind the reader of the infirmary occupants, etc. They must eat, and besides, social gatherings of members of this", "usage": {"type": "tokens", "total_tokens": 10060, "input_tokens": 10060, "input_token_details": {"text_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 10060}, "output_tokens": 0}}
